# F.O.S.T Kata

In *src/statement.js* there is some code that
has not gotten the love it deserves for
awhile.

In *tests/statement.test.js* you find a couple
of tests that you can use for testing if you
break things; they are not complete or perfect
but for the small refactorings we will do in
this kata, they are good enough.

# Rules

You are only allowed to do the following
to improve statement.js:

  - rename identifier
  - remove commented out code
  - improve comment
  - format code
  - extract and inline variable
